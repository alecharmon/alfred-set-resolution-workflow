# Set Resolution Workflow for Alfred App

Handy workflow to change between available screen resolutions, even between normal and HiDPI mode (Retina).

## Usage


## Multiple Displays

The workflow does not support multiple displays, although the cli app does. Since I don't have a second display to develop and test, I haven't implemented it. Happy to accept PL from others here.
